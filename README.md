# SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction-A-Data-Science-Journey
Objective: Predict Falcon 9 first-stage landing success to estimate launch costs.
Methods: Collected data via SpaceX API and web scraping, performed EDA with visualizations and SQL, built Folium maps and Plotly Dash dashboards, and developed classification models
(Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN).
Results: Achieved 83.33% test accuracy with SVM and Decision Tree; identified payload mass and orbit type as key predictors.
Impact: Insights enable competitors to bid strategically against SpaceX.
